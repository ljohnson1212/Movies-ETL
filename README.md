# Movies-ETL

# Project Overview
		Amazon Prime was amazed with our work in the module that they want us to update the dataset so that we can create an automated pipeline that receives new data, performs accurate transformations and uploads information into tables already created. In this challenge we will create a function that will add data from Wikipedia, Kaggle and MovieLens to a PostgreSQL database.
	
		This challenge requires four deliverables which include:
			Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
			Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
			Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
			Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database
